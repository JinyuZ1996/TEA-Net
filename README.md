## **Overall description** 
Here presents the code of TEA-Net. We upload the relevant datasets (i.e., Douban and Amazon) on Bitbucket: [https://bitbucket.org/jinyuz1996/tea-net-data/src/main/](https://bitbucket.org/jinyuz1996/tea-net-data/src/main/). You should download them before running TEA_Net. The code is attached to our paper: **"Towards Lightweight Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation via Tri-Branches Graph External Attention Network" (J-CRAD 2024)**. If you want to use our codes or datasets in your research, please cite our paper. You can get the official paper here: [https://crad.ict.ac.cn/cn/article/doi/10.7544/issn1000-1239.202440197](https://crad.ict.ac.cn/cn/article/doi/10.7544/issn1000-1239.202440197).
## **Code description** 
### **Implementation details**
